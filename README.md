dfinity sdk 

The error message:

kotlin

Edit
'dfx' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
means that your system does not recognize the dfx command because the DFINITY Canister SDK (dfx) is either:

Not installed, or

Not added to your system's PATH.

‚úÖ Here's how to fix it:
üîß 1. Install the DFINITY SDK (if not installed)
Open your terminal (Command Prompt / PowerShell) and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://smartcontracts.org/install.sh)"
This installs the dfx tool for working with the Internet Computer (IC).

Note: On Windows, it's better to use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) or Git Bash to run this command. CMD and PowerShell don't support sh.

üõ†Ô∏è 2. Add dfx to your PATH (if already installed)
If you've installed it but still get the error, you need to add it to your system's environment variables.

The dfx binary is usually located at:
~/bin/dfx on Unix-like systems
C:\Users\<YourUsername>\bin on Windows (if installed via Git Bash or similar)

To add it to PATH on Windows:
Press Windows + S, search for "Environment Variables", and open it.

Under System Properties ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Environment Variables, find the Path variable under your user variables.

Click Edit, then New, and paste the path to the folder containing dfx.exe.

Click OK and restart your terminal.

‚úÖ To verify:
After installation or adding it to PATH, restart your terminal and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
dfx --version
If successful, you'll see the installed version printed.
